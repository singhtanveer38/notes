## Definition

A data warehouse is a type of data management system that is designed to enable and support business intelligence (BI) activities, especially analytics. Data warehouses are solely intended to perform queries and analysis and often contain large amounts of historical data. The data within a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide range of sources such as application log files and transaction applications.

## Consisting of

1. A relational database to store and manage data
2. An extraction, loading, and transformation (ELT) solution for preparing the data for analysis
3. Statistical analysis, reporting, and data mining capabilities
4. Client analysis tools for visualizing and presenting data to business users
5. Other, more sophisticated analytical applications that generate actionable information by applying data science and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, or graph and spatial features that enable more kinds of analysis of data at scale

## Characteristics

1. __Subject-oriented__: They can analyze data about a particular subject or functional area (such as sales).
2. __Integrated__: Data warehouses create consistency among different data types from disparate sources.
3. __Nonvolatile__: Once data is in a data warehouse, it’s stable and doesn’t change.
4. __Time-variant__: Data warehouse analysis looks at change over time.
